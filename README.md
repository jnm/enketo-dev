# kobo (some) docker
*fighting complexity with simplicity*

## goal
As a developer, I would like to run things I don't change inside Docker (PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB, and—for now—Enketo Exporess).
I would like full, manual control over running code that I do change (kpi Python, kpi JS, kobocat Python).
I would like simplicity in configuration with sensible defaults and a minimum of mandatory customization.
